# *Analysis Report: Content Categories for Social Buzz*
## *1. Summary of Findings*
This document presents the results and methodologies from a three-month analytical project aimed at Social Buzz, a prominent platform in social media and content creation. The primary focus was to determine the top five content categories that engage users by analyzing a large volume of unstructured data.

## *2. Background*
Social Buzz, established in 2010 and headquartered in San Francisco, has experienced rapid growth, currently serving over 500 million active users each month. As the organization prepares for its Initial Public Offering (IPO), it faces challenges related to scaling its operations. To address these challenges, Social Buzz partnered with Accenture to conduct an evaluation of its big data practices and analyze its most effective content categories.

## *4. Team Composition*
The project was executed by a dedicated team, which included:

- *Andre:* Chief Technical Architect, responsible for overseeing the technical components of the analysis.
- *Marcus Rompton:* Senior Principal, leading the data engineering efforts and ensuring data accuracy.
- *Priyanka:* Data Analytics Lead, tasked with conducting the analysis and presenting the insights.
